# Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB)

YCSB is an [open-source](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/) database benchmark suite. AQA performance testing currently only supports YCSB with Azure Cosmos DB, but other databases may be added in the future.

## Running YCSB with Azure Cosmos DB

Refer to [the source](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/azurecosmos) for an indepth explanation of running YCSB with Azure Cosmos DB, or follow the instructions below.

## Setup

This benchmark expects you to have pre-created the database "ycsb" and collection "usertable" before running the commands. When prompted for a Partition Key, use "id". For [Request Units (RUs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units), select a value you want to benchmark. RUs are the measure of provisioned thoughput that Azure Cosmos DB defines. The higher the RUs, the more throughput you will get.

## Properties

Configuration parameters for the benchmark should be set in the azurecosmos.properties file, which should be created in the ycsb directory (the current directory). A template version of this file azurecosmos-template.properties is included for reference.

There are two required parameters for connecting to the database:

azurecosmos.uri=< uri string >
* Path to your Azure Cosmos DB account which can be obtained from the portal. It will look like the following: https://accountname.documents.azure.com:443/

azurecosmos.primaryKey=< key string >
* Obtained from the portal. The primary key is used to allow both read & write operations. If you are doing read-only workloads you can substitute the readonly key from the portal.

The other optional parameters and their default values are defined in the template configuration file azurecosmos-template.properties.

## Passing properties on the command line

Additional YCSB properties can also be set on the command line instead of using the azurecosmos.properties file. Properties set on the command line can also be used to override properties in the file. These can be passed through the `EXTRA_YCSB_PROPERTIES` environment variable. For example, this variable could contain `-p useUpsert=true -p operationcount=10000`.
