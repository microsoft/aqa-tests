## SPECjbb 2015

SPECjbb is a Java Client/Server performance testing benchmark. 
Please visit its product page for more information, including a user guide: https://www.spec.org/jbb2015/


## Prerequisites
Since SPECjbb requires a license to run, this aqa-test config requires that a licensed copy of the benchmark already exists on the machine that you are running on.

## Setup

Set the `SPECJBB_SRC` environment variable to the absolute path of your SPECjbb benchmark directory
```
export SPECJBB_SRC=/Users/aqa-tester/SPECjbb2015-1.03
```

## Run

The configuration currently includes one group, `extended`, and that group contains one test, `SPECjbb2015-multijvm-simple`. You can use the following commands to run it:
```
make _testList TESTLIST=SPECjbb2015-multijvm-simple
```
